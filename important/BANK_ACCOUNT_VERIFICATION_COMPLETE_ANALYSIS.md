## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Solution**

### **Option A: Enhanced Verification Flow (IMPLEMENTED)**

Instead of removing verification (impossible), we implemented a dramatically improved user experience:

#### **1. Enhanced User Communication**

**Before (Problematic):**
```
Status: Unknown Status
Payments enabled: No
Payouts enabled: No
```

**After (Clear & Educational):**
```
Status: Verification in Progress (1-2 business days)

Why is verification required?
‚Ä¢ Legal Compliance: Required by Swedish and EU financial regulations
‚Ä¢ Security: Protects both buyers and sellers from fraud  
‚Ä¢ Trust: Ensures all marketplace participants are verified

What happens next?
Stripe will verify your information automatically. You'll receive an email 
notification when your account is approved and ready to receive payments.
```

#### **2. Progressive Information Disclosure**

**Smart UI Logic:**
- **New Users**: Welcome message explaining benefits and requirements
- **Verification Pending**: Progress indicators, timeline, and educational content
- **Active Accounts**: Account capabilities and detailed information
- **Issues/Restricted**: Actionable guidance and support contact information

#### **3. Comprehensive Status Management**

**Status Mapping:**
- `null/undefined` ‚Üí "Verification in Progress" (Blue, educational)
- `pending` ‚Üí "Pending Verification" (Yellow, with timeline)
- `active` ‚Üí "Active & Verified" (Green, capabilities shown)
- `restricted` ‚Üí "Additional Info Required" (Red, actionable steps)
- `inactive` ‚Üí "Inactive" (Gray, support contact)
