Hello Cynthia,

Thank you for your assistance with the account review. Here are the details about our Mailjet usage for the Nordic Loop platform:

## Monthly Sending Volume:
- Estimated 500-1,000 emails per month (primarily transactional emails for password resets)

## Business Description:
Nordic Loop is a B2B marketplace platform connecting companies in the recycling industry. Our platform allows companies to place ads for materials they want to sell and place bids on materials they want to purchase, facilitating circular economy transactions.

## Regarding Transactional Messages:

1. **How will they be triggered?**
   Our transactional emails are triggered exclusively by user actions, specifically:
   - Password reset requests (sending OTP codes)
   - Account verification
   - Notification of bid/offer activity (when users receive bids on their listings)

2. **Sample Email:**
   Here's a sample of our password reset email:


   HTML version:
   ```html
   <h3>Password Reset OTP</h3>
   <p>Your OTP for password reset is: <strong>123456</strong></p>
   <p>This OTP will expire in 30 minutes.</p>
   ```

### Important Notes:

- We are NOT sending any marketing emails or bulk messages
- All emails are strictly transactional and triggered by specific user actions
- We do not maintain any marketing lists or purchased contact databases
- All users are registered on our platform and have explicitly agreed to receive these transactional emails

Please let me know if you need any additional information to complete the account review.

Best regards, 
Olivier
