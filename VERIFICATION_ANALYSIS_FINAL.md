üìã Why is verification required?
‚Ä¢ Legal Compliance: Required by Swedish and EU financial regulations
‚Ä¢ Security: Protects both buyers and sellers from fraud

üìß What happens next?
Stripe will verify your information automatically. You'll receive an email 
notification when your account is approved and ready to receive payments.
```

**Smart Display Logic:**
