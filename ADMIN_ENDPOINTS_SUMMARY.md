## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ All endpoints require admin authentication (IsAdminUser permission)
- ✅ Proper error handling for non-existent resources
- ✅ Returns 401 for unauthenticated requests
- ✅ Returns 403 for non-admin users
- ✅ Comprehensive logging of admin actions

## 🧪 Testing

All endpoints have been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ Successful operations
- ✅ Error handling (non-existent resources)
- ✅ Authentication and authorization checks
- ✅ Edge cases and validation

## 📝 Example Usage

### Admin Ad Operations

```bash
# Get JWT token first (replace with actual credentials)
TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"

# Suspend an ad
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/ads/admin/ads/123/suspend/"

# Approve an ad
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/ads/admin/ads/123/approve/"
```

### Admin Bid Operations

```bash
# Approve a bid
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/bids/admin/bids/456/approve/"

# Reject a bid
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/bids/admin/bids/456/reject/"

# Mark bid as won
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/bids/admin/bids/456/mark-as-won/"

# List all bids (with optional filtering)
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/bids/admin/bids/?status=active&page=1&page_size=10"
```

## 🎯 Business Logic

### Ad Management
- **Normal Flow**: Users can publish completed ads without admin approval
- **Admin Intervention**: When ads violate regulations:
  1. Admin suspends the ad (`suspended_by_admin=True`)
  2. User cannot reactivate until admin approval
  3. Admin can later approve the ad
  4. After approval, user can publish normally

### Bid Management
- **Admin Approve**: Sets bid status to 'active' (useful for bids that were flagged)
- **Admin Reject**: Sets bid status to 'cancelled' (for inappropriate bids)
- **Admin Mark as Won**: Manually determines auction winner, marks other bids as 'lost'

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Database Fields Used

**Ads:**
- `status`: 'active', 'suspended', etc.
- `suspended_by_admin`: Boolean flag to prevent user reactivation
- `is_active`: Controls public visibility

**Bids:**
- `status`: 'active', 'cancelled', 'won', 'lost', etc.

### Error Responses

All endpoints return consistent JSON error responses:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message here"
}
```

Success responses include:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "ad": { /* ad data */ }  // for ad endpoints
}
```

## 🚀 Ready for Production

All admin endpoints are fully functional and ready for use in the admin interface. The implementation follows Django REST Framework best practices and includes proper error handling, authentication, and logging.
