## 🔧 **Custom Development Evidence**

### **1. Advanced Material Auction System**
```python
# Dynamic workflow based on material type
def get_step_completion_status(self):
    is_plastic = self.category.name.lower() in ['plastic', 'plastics']
    
    if is_plastic:
        # 8-step process for plastic materials
        return {1: step_1_complete, 2: step_2_complete, ..., 8: step_8_complete}
    else:
        # 4-step process for other materials  
        return {1: step_1_complete, 6: step_6_complete, 7: step_7_complete, 8: step_8_complete}
```

### **2. Sophisticated Payment Processing**
```python  
# Platform-hold model with commission calculation
def create_payment_intent(self, payment_intent_obj):
    intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
        amount=total_amount_cents,
        metadata={
            'payment_flow': 'platform_hold_and_transfer',
            'commission_rate': str(payment_intent_obj.commission_rate),
            'seller_account_id': seller_company.stripe_account_id,
        }
    )
```

### **3. Hybrid Cloud Storage System**
```python
# Cloudflare R2 with local fallback
def upload_image(self, image_file, folder="material_images", user_id=None):
    # Try Cloudflare R2 first
    if r2_enabled:
        r2_success, r2_message, r2_url = r2_storage_service.upload_image(image_file, folder, user_id)
        if r2_success:
            return True, "Image uploaded to R2 successfully", r2_url
    
    # Fallback to local storage
    local_url = self._upload_to_local(image_file, folder, user_id)
    return True, "Image uploaded to local storage successfully", local_url
```
